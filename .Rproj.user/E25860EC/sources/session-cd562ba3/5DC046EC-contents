# ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance)

**F statistic:** `F = (variance between groups) / (variance within groups)`

Null hypothesis: all groups have the same mean

Alternate hypothesis: 2+ groups have different means

## ANOVA in R

`aov(data = dataset, numeric_var ~ cat_var)`

`numeric_var`: the numeric variable you want to use to test for a difference

`cat_var`: the categorical variable that you want to compare the groups of

`~`: we can think of this as a `by` symbol

## Finding Meaning of ANOVA in R

`anova_test <- aov(data = dataset, numeric_var ~ cat_var)`

`summary(anova_test)` : gives us overall summary if any categories are different

`TuleyHSD(anova_test)` : tells us which categories are different

-   *\*\*\*`TukeyHSD` requires categorical variables to be factors, so you have to coerce them into factors by using `factor(cat_var)` \*\*\**

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r Sepal Length}
anova_results <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, iris)

## Are any groups different from each other?
summary(anova_results)

## Which ones?
TukeyHSD(anova_results)
## ALL the mean sepal lengths are significantly different from each other
```

```{r Sepal Width}
anova_results <- aov(Sepal.Width ~ Species, iris)

## Are any groups different from each other?
summary(anova_results)

## Which ones?
TukeyHSD(anova_results)
## ALL the mean sepal widths are significantly different from each other
```

```{r}
## Is there a significant difference in the mean petal lengths or petal widths by species?
anova_results <- aov(Petal.Length ~ Species, iris)
summary(anova_results)
TukeyHSD(anova_results)
## ALL the mean petal lengths are significantly different from each other

anova_results <- aov(Petal.Width ~ Species, iris)
summary(anova_results)
TukeyHSD(anova_results)
## ALL the mean petal widths are significantly different from each other
```

Now let's practice with Star Wars!

```{r}
unique(starwars$species)

## Which five species are the most common?
top3Species <- starwars |> 
  summarize(.by = species, count = sum(!is.na(species))) |> slice_max(count, n = 3)
            
starwars_top3Species <-  starwars |> filter(species %in% top3Species$species)
```

### Practice

```{r}
## is there a significant difference in the mass of each of the top 3 species
a <- aov(mass ~ species, starwars_top3Species)
summary(a)
TukeyHSD(a)

## no, there is no significant difference
```

## Chi Squared Test in R

Used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two variables

To get counts per group combination, we can use `con_table <- table(data$var1, data$var2)` . For accurate results, make sure you have 10 or more observations in your group

`chisq_results <- chisq.test(con_table)` . To get the significance, we can pull out the p-value from results: `chisq_results$p.value` and `chisq_results$residuals`

-   Negative residual means observed \< expected

-   Positive residual means observed \> expected

-   Farther from 0, the greater the difference

```{r}
starwars_clean <- starwars |> 
  filter(!is.na(species),
         !is.na(homeworld))

t <- table(starwars_clean$species, starwars_clean$homeworld)
chisq.test(t) ## not enough data
```

Since there isn't enough data in starwars, let's look at mpg!

```{r}

## How do we get a contingency table of year and drive
View(mpg)
t <- table(mpg$year, mpg$drv)

chisq_result <- chisq.test(t)
chisq_result$p.value
chisq_result$residuals
```

Corrplot:

``` r
{r}
## install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)

corrplot(chisq_result$residuals)
```

Heroes data set:

```{r}
heroes <- read.csv("../data/heroes_information.csv")

## clean data
heroes_clean <- heroes |>
  filter(Alignment != "-",
         Gender != "-")

## plot the counts of aligment and gender
ggplot(heroes_clean, aes(x = Gender, y = Alignment)) + 
  geom_count()+
  theme_minimal()

## make contingency table
t <- table(heroes_clean$Alignment, heroes_clean$Gender)

## chi squared test
chi <- chisq.test(t)
chi$p.value
chi$residuals

corrplot(chi$residuals, is.cor = F)
```

# Difference between tests

## T-test

-   determine whether the means of ***two samples*** are statistically difference from each other

-   Test statistic is based on sample means and standard error

-   Can be paired or independent

-   Can be one-tailed or two-tailed

    -   `t.test(group1$var, group2$var)`

## ANOVA

-   determine whether the means of ***two or more samples*** are statistically different from each other

-   test statistic is based on within-sample and between-sample variance

## Chi-Square

-   determine whether ***two variables*** are independent or associated

-   Test statistics is based on expected and observed counts
